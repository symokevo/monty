Monty is the missing complement to Python. Monty implements supplementary useful functions for Python that are not part of the standard library. Examples include useful utilities like transparent support for zipped files, useful design patterns such as singleton and cached_class, and many more.

Python is a great programming language and comes with "batteries included". However, even Python has missing functionality and/or quirks that make it more difficult to do many simple tasks.

Monty is created to serve as a complement to the Python standard library. It provides suite of tools to solve many common problems, and hopefully, be a resource to collect the best solutions.

Monty supports Python 3.x.
